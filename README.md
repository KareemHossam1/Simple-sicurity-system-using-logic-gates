A security system allows 4 users to have an access to an entry room if the password they entered is correct. Only one user is allowed to have the access to enter the room even if another user entered the correct password. The user number who have the access to enter the room will be displayed on a seven segment. Some users have the priority to enter the room if there are more than one user entered a right password.
